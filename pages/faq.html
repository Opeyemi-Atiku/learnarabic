                            <p>The problem with most Arabic courses and websites is that they teach MSA as a spoken language. Nobody anywhere on earth speaks MSA as a native language. Most Arabs will understand you if you speak MSA but you almost certainly
                                will not understand them when they speak. Many students study MSA for years in Western universities yet when they travel to the Middle East, they struggle to have even the most basic conversations with native speakers.
                                Why? Because they've learned a language that nobody speaks. If you want to really connect with and understand people then you need to learn a spoken variety of Arabic. We will help you do that.</p>
